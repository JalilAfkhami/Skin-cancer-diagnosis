- runs: consists of weight and result image files
- notebook: consists of Jupyter Notebooks
## Results
The mAP[Box] at 0.50 IoU is 57.4 and at 0.50:0.95 IoU is 42.7. And the mAP[Mask] at 0.50 IoU is 55.9 and at 0.50:0.95 IoU is 41.2. It is much better! considering that it is a Nano model, it’s pretty good.
