# Skin-cancer-diagnosis
Skin cancer detection using YOLOv8n-seg

## Project Structure
- src: consists of Python scripts
- data: consists of data
- runs: consists of weight and result image files
- notebook: consists of Jupyter Notebooks
## Results
The mAP[Box] at 0.50 IoU is 57.4 and at 0.50:0.95 IoU is 42.7. And the mAP[Mask] at 0.50 IoU is 55.9 and at 0.50:0.95 IoU is 41.2. Considering that it is a Nano model, itâ€™s pretty good.
